Dist::Zilla::Plugin::lib

Dist::Zilla::Plugin::lib serves as a relatively straight-forward and
uncomplicated way to wire certain local paths in your distributions
source tree into Perl's @INC library load path.

Its primary audiences are twofold.

Self-Building Dist::Zilla Plugins
    Many recent Dist::Zilla plugin workflows champion a state of "lib/"
    which are usable "as is" without needing to cycle through a "dzil
    build" phase first, and this plugin offers a simple way to stash
    "lib/" in @INC without needing to pass "-Ilib" every time you run
    "dzil".

    Workflows that require a build cycle to self-build should use
    "[Bootstrap::lib]" instead.

Bundled Dist::Zilla Plugins
    Many heavy "CPAN" distributions have bundled within them custom
    "Dist::Zilla" plugins stashed in "inc/"

    Traditionally, these are loaded via "[=inc::Foo::Package]"
    exploiting the long held assumption that "." ( $CWD ) is contained
    in @INC

    However, that is becoming a less safe assumption, and this plugin
    aims to make such equivalent behaviour practical without needing to
    rely on that assumption.
